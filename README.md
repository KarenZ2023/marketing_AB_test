## Problem Statement
The goal of this project is to analyze Marketing A/B Testing results to assess whether displaying ads leads to a significant increase in conversion rates compared to showing public service announcements (PSAs).

## Dataset
The dataset used in this analysis is obtained from Kaggle: [Marketing A/B Testing Dataset.](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/faviovaz/marketing-ab-testing?resource=download)

## Methods
1. Data Exploration:
    - Investigate null values and duplicate users.
    - Explore differences between control and experimental groups in terms of group size, conversion rates, and other metrics.
2. Data Analysis:
    - Utilize permutation and bootstrapping methods to evaluate the impact of ads on conversion rates.
    
## Key Findings
A significant difference in conversion rates was observed between the control (PSA) and experimental (Ads) groups.
The company should proceed with displaying ads to all viewers based on the observed positive effect on conversion rates.
