# Marketing A/B Testing Analysis
This project analyzes whether a company's new ad increases product purchases and revenue. In this A/B testing experiment, consumers are either shown an ad or a public service announcement(PSA). The dataset is obtained from Kaggle: [Marketing A/B Testing Dataset.](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/faviovaz/marketing-ab-testing?resource=download)

Using permutation and boostrapping methods, we determined that there is significant difference in conversion rates was observed between the control (PSA) and experimental (Ads) groups. The company should proceed with displaying ads to all viewers based on the observed positive effect on conversion rates.

        Specifically for data exploration, we investigate null values and duplicate users and explore differences between control and experimental groups in terms of group size, conversion rates. For data analysis, we utilize permutation and bootstrapping methods to evaluate the impact of ads on conversion rates.
